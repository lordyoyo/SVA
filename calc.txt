calculations:

multiply:
seasons (special with pigs)
28 (special with pigs)
1/days (special with sheep)
chance
number of aminals

this is base multiplier for produces

for the four rarities:
    [done]calculate chance or coopchance or shepchance or botchance
    check if we process, if we do:
        processed.result.split(".")
        produceData[split[0]][split[1]].price
        multiply by quantity
            multiply by arti if it exists and ranc if it doesn't or just leave it if neither
            get the name
        or take the price if it doesn't exist
        take name
        multiply this by calculated chance
            multiply by ranc if not pigs
    if we don't
        take the price
        take name
        multiply by calculated chance
            multiply by ranc if not pigs
    multi by 1.2 if pig and gath
put it in array of arrays
    sum up whatevers
divide by season number and 28 for perday
